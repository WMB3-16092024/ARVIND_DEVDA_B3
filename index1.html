        <div class="text"> In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum (/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/) is a placeholder text
            commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful
            content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before the final copy is available. It is also used to
            temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a
            webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.

            Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the
            Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and
            improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of dolorem ipsum ("pain itself").

            Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was
            popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital
            world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop
            publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since
            adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as have many LaTeX packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as Joomla! and
            WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.

            Example text
            A common form of Lorem ipsum reads:

            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
            dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex
            ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat
            nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit
            anim id est laborum.

            Source text
            The Lorem ipsum text is derived from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et
            malorum.[6][7] The physical source may have been the 1914 Loeb Classical Library edition of De finibus,
            where the Latin text, presented on the left-hand (even) pages, breaks off on page 34 with "Neque porro
            quisquam est qui do-" and continues on page 36 with "lorem ipsum ...", suggesting that the galley type of
            that page was mixed up to make the dummy text seen today.[1]
            The first use of Lorem ipsum is uncertain, though some have suggested the 1500s, when sections of Classical
            works were often used as dummy texts by printers to make type specimen books demonstrating different fonts.
            According to this account, the material was chosen based on Latin’s familiarity as a lingua franca across
            Europe and the popularity of Classical works during the Middle Ages. Whenever it was first created, Lorem
            ipsum did not gain widespread popularity until the 1960s, when Letraset manufactured preprinted transfer
            sheets that featured the passage for use in the advertising industry. The sheets allowed typesetters and
            designers to cut out and rub on the text in various fonts, sizes, and formats for mock-ups and prototypes.

            In the 1980s, during the rise of the personal computer, Aldus Corporation developed its PageMaker desktop
            publishing software, which included Lorem ipsum as a word processing feature. Other word processors,
            including Microsoft Word, adopted the feature, and it became ubiquitous as a placeholder in Web design. Most
            Web content management systems, such as Joomla! and Wordpress, also feature a plug-in that generates Lorem
            ipsum.

            The Lorem ipsum text was thought to be random words until the 1990s, when its source was discovered by
            Richard McClintock, an American professor and Latin scholar. He traced the text to a passage from the 1914
            Loeb Classical Library edition of De finibus bonorum et malorum (“On the Ends of Good and Evil”), a treatise
            on ethics by Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero from 45 bce. In the original passage, the first sentence
            used in the dummy text reads:
        </div>
    </body>
